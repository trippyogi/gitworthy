# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Add `scan` core, CLI, and MCP tool for listing open issue tracker candidates before running `worth_check`.
- Keep scan explicitly non-verdict-bearing: it returns tracker candidates only and says tracker state can lag reality in `not_checked`.

## 0.1.1

- Reduce evidence noise by filtering generic issue terms before tree, grep, and branch keyword matching, while preserving calibrated `checked` and `not_checked` output.
- Improve contribution policy extraction so each excerpt maps to one best category or is marked ambiguous, avoiding false CLA matches from architecture text.
- Remove `posthog-node` from default dependencies. Telemetry remains off by default and degrades to no-op with a warning if requested without the optional package installed.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release with CLI, MCP server, six core checks, calibrated envelopes, cache support, and live acceptance fixtures.
